1) The code for this project was created by following the steps described at:

    How to Build a Java RESTful API with Spring Boot
    By Kelly Arellano // April 23, 2021
    https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-build-an-api-with-java/

2) Since we have this configuration in the maven file of this project:

            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.jsonschema2pojo</groupId>
                <artifactId>jsonschema2pojo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.0.2</version>
                <configuration>
                    <sourceDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/schema</sourceDirectory>
                    <targetPackage>org.example.restfullapicasetwo.rest.api.types</targetPackage>
                    <useTitleAsClassname>true</useTitleAsClassname>
                    <includeAdditionalProperties>false</includeAdditionalProperties>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>generate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>

And since we added the json schema files (that we created according to https://json-schema.org/specification and https://www.w3schools.in/json/json-schemas/#google_vignette) to the folder:

    /src/main/resources/schema

We run the command:

    mvn generate-sources

and we look for the generated classes at:

./target/generated-sources/jsonschema2pojo/org/example/restfullapicasetwo/rest/api/types

Then we copy these files to the folder:

src/main/java/org/example/restfullapicasetwo/model

or add the full path of the target folder with the types to the classpath of the project.
